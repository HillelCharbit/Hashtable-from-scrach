# skip List and Hash Table Implementation
This repository contains Java implementations of a Skip List and Hash Table from scratch. Both data structures offer efficient search, insert, and delete operations.

# Skip List
The Skip List is a probabilistic data structure with fast average O(log n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete.

# Hash Table
The Hash Table provides quick insertion, deletion, and retrieval of key-value pairs using a hash function.

# Usage
See examples in each file for how to use the data structures.

# Contributing
Contributions, issues, and suggestions are welcome!

Happy coding!
